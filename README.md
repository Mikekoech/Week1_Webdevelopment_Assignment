🌐 Mike Koech Portfolio (HTML5 Assignment)
📖 Overview

This project is my Introduction to HTML5 assignment, created as part of the PLP Web Technologies course. The goal is to practice semantic HTML5 structure, accessibility best practices, and basic SEO principles while building a simple portfolio page.

The page introduces me as a Full Stack Developer, outlines my areas of expertise, and lists some sample projects.

🎯 Objectives

Use semantic HTML5 elements (<header>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, <section>, <aside>, <footer>).

Apply accessibility best practices (clear structure, proper headings, descriptive links).

Ensure SEO-friendly content (logical heading hierarchy, meaningful metadata, crawlable structure).

Deliver a single HTML file named index.html.

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML5 only (no CSS or JavaScript required at this stage).

📂 Structure of index.html

Header → Name & navigation bar

Main Content →

Article: About Me (developer bio)

Section: Areas of expertise (ordered list)

Aside: Projects list with links

Footer → Copyright
